Hello Professor. This is project for Group 8 with Nick Stanton, Victor Pimentel and Edwin Ciriaco. Our project is managing ticket 
sales for a movie theatre and allow users to buy tickets, contact the site, leave reviews for movies and also "recommend" or "do 
not recommend" them. In order to create our database and work with the project you simply need to run the dbcreate SQL file in the 
includes folder. As the site works currently the first user created will be given admin status. Currently all that means is that 
when that user goes to the contact page they can see the submissions for any users and can mark those submissions as "resolved". 
All following users created will be regular users. The movies that are currently available are hardcoded and will be made when the 
sql file is ran. You shouldn't need to do anything other than run the sql file once and then arrange the dbh.inc.php variables to 
match your local settings to make the project run smoothly. A picture of the DB schema is included in the images folder.

Thank you for a great semester
Group 8
